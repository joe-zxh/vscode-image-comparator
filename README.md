# Image Comparator
Extension to compare images via VSCode.

## Usage
`cmd + shift + p` -> `Image Comparator: Open Window`, opens a new comparison window.

Once the window is open, right click on image files (`.png`/`.jpg`/`.jpeg`) in the context menu, this will give the option `Image Comparator: Add Image` to add an image to the comparison window. 

You can add as many images as you want, closing the comparator window will reset the image list. 

## Running the example
- Open in VS Code 1.47+
- `npm install`
- `npm run watch` or `npm run compile`
- `F5` to start debugging

# TODO List
- Automatically scale imageViewer size to display scale
